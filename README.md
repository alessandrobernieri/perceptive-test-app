# Perceptive Test

This web application was developed as part of a Bachelor's degree thesis project at Universit√† Bicocca in Milan. It is coded primarily in Python, utilizing Flask for the user interface, MySQL with SQLAlchemy for database management, and HTML/CSS for web presentation.

# Key Features
- Create New Perceptive Tests: Easily create new perceptive tests, whether they involve video content or images.
- Edit Existing Tests: Modify the title, description, and instructions of tests that have already been created, ensuring they stay up to date and relevant.
- Multiple Modes: The application offers three distinct modes for tests: single, double, and ranked. These modes cater to various testing scenarios and needs.
- Discrete or Continuous Evaluation: Choose between discrete or continuous evaluation methods to best suit your research or assessment requirements.
- Resume Tests: Users can resume tests that were previously started, thanks to session management features. This enhances the user experience and facilitates data collection.
- Randomized Presentation: Content, whether images or video, is presented in a random order to reduce bias and improve test validity.
